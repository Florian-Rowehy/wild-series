Years later, Steven used his family''s traumatic experiences to write his book, straining the bonds with his siblings. Although it became a best-seller, Steven missed most of the frightening experiences and does not actually believe in the paranormal.

Steven returns home, whereby he sees Luke trying to leave with some equipment that was stolen from his apartment. When Steven enters the apartment, he finds Nell there.

Some time after she and her family have left Hill House, a funeral is held for Olivia and an initially distraught Shirley is surprised and in awe that the mortician was able to "fix" her mother. As an adult, Shirley is now a mortician who owns a funeral business alongside her husband, Kevin, and rents a guest house to Theo, who is now a child therapist. Shirley soon gets a call from Steven, who informs her of Nell''s death. Distraught and shaken, she requests that Nell''s corpse be brought to her and she embalms her sister herself.

Olivia reveals to Theo that her grandmother (and by extent, she and her daughters) are "sensitive" and gives Theo a pair of gloves to protect her hands. While working as a therapist for children in foster care, Theo comes across a child that she can''t "read" and who claims to be tormented by "Mr. Smiley", a monster that lives in the basement.
